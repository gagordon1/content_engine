Following a series of victories and losses, the French and American forces united in 1781 to trap Cornwallis's army, which had fortified itself in Yorktown. With the French naval fleet blocking any escape by sea, Cornwallis found himself encircled. Washington orchestrated a clever march from New York, using misinformation to deceive the British about his intentions.

By October 17, Cornwallis requested terms of surrender after two days of negotiations. The surrender ceremony on October 19 was marked by tension and formality; Cornwallis was notably absent, claiming illness. Instead, Brigadier General O'Hara surrendered to American General Lincoln, symbolizing a significant defeat for the British.
